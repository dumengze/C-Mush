# Enhancing Mushroom Recognition through Data Augmentation with Text-Guided Diffusion Models

This work presents a data augmentation method using diffusion models to generate high-quality mushroom images from text prompts. Diffusion models provide a more powerful approach than traditional techniques by creating realistic and diverse images that capture detailed features of multiple mushroom species. The augmented dataset helps improve classification accuracy, especially for minority classes, by addressing data scarcity. Additionally, integrating a Top-k recommendation method enhances predictive performance. The results highlight the effectiveness of diffusion models in generating mushroom images, offering a promising solution for improving dataset quality and classification tasks.
